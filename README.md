# particle-in-a-box
This MATLAB GUI provides a visual representation and interactive exploration of the particle-in-a-box problem, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. The particle-in-a-box model considers a particle confined within a one-dimensional box and studies its energy states and corresponding wavefunctions.

# Features
Visualization: The GUI displays the potential energy well and overlays the probability density functions for different energy eigenstates. Users can observe the behavior of the particle inside the box in real-time.

Interactive Controls: Users can adjust the width and height of the box, allowing them to explore different system configurations and observe the resulting energy levels and wavefunctions.

Energy Spectrum: The GUI provides a visual representation of the energy spectrum, allowing users to observe and compare the energy levels of different eigenstates.

Wavefunction Analysis: Users can select specific energy eigenstates to analyze their corresponding wavefunctions. The GUI displays the wavefunction graphically and provides numerical values at specific points.

# Usage
